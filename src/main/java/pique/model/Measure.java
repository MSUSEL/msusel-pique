/**
 * A Measure is a concrete, numerical way to measure a given ProductFactor (property of source code).
 * The components necessary to complete a Measure's evaluation are a Measure's Diagnostics.
 *
 * A Measure is therefore a collection of its necessary diagnostics and an evaluation function describing
 * how to evaluate itself using its diagnostics.
 *
 * Metrics example: for a metrics Measure "MIF" (Method Inheritance Factor) that is evaluated by the formula
 * 							MIF = inherited methods / total methods available
 *  	and you have a static analysis tool that can find IM (inherited methods) and TMA (total methods available),
 *  	IM and TMA are Diagnostic objects, and the Measure object MIF's eval function is IM::value / TMA::value.
 *
 *  Rule example: for a rule Measure "Encryption Faults" that is evaluated by the sum of all tool findings that relate
 *  	to encryption, imagine a tool named Security Code Scan that has 3 rules relating to encryption, "SCS001", "SCS002",
 *  	and "SCS003".  SCS001, SCS002, and SCS003 are Diagnostic objects whose eval function should be to sum the
 *  	findings with their Diagnostic name.  The Measure "Encryption Faults" may then eval by suming its diagnostic
 *  	object's evals.
